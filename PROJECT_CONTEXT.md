# Project Context: Granja Cerdito Feliz

This document tracks the development progress of new features for the "Granja Cerdito Feliz" platform.

## Current Task: Calendar Management Enhancement

The current development effort is focused on adding new functionality to the "Gesti贸n de Calendarios" (Calendar Management) page. The work is being done on the `desarrollo` branch of the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Gerard2167/granja-cerdito-feliz

### Feature Requirements:

1.  **Assign Responsible Person:**
    *   Add an option to assign a "responsable" (person in charge) to a calendar task.
    *   The list of available "responsables" should be populated from the "Colaboradores" (Collaborators) page.

2.  **Role-Based Access Control:**
    *   This new assignment functionality should only be available to users with the "Administrador General" or "Supervisor Producci贸n" roles.

3.  **Task Visibility:**
    *   Assigned tasks should only be visible to the assigned collaborator.

4.  **Task Completion:**
    *   Allow the assigned collaborator to attach a photo as proof of work.
    *   Provide an action to mark the task as "completado" (completed).

## Development Environment

*   The local development environment uses **XAMPP**.
*   The **MySQL** database server must be started from the XAMPP control panel for the application to connect to the database.

## Development Status

*   **Previous Session:** The implementation of the features described above was completed.
*   **Problem:** Testing was blocked because the server failed to run due to a database connection error (`ECONNREFUSED`). This was resolved by starting the MySQL service via the XAMPP control panel.
*   **Update 1:** After starting the server, an error occurred while creating a collaborator ("Error al guardar colaborador"). The server log showed a `400 Bad Request` and hinted at a missing `user_id` column.
*   **Fix 1:** Investigated `server/index.js` and found that the `POST /colaboradores` endpoint had an undefined query. Corrected the endpoint to properly build the `INSERT` statement.
*   **Update 2:** The error persisted, with the server log showing `Error: Unknown column \'user_id\' in \'field list\'`. This indicated the database schema was outdated.
*   **Fix 2:** Added an `ALTER TABLE` command to `server/index.js` to automatically add the `user_id` column to the `colaboradores` table on server startup, resolving the issue.
*   **Update 3:** A similar "Unknown column" error occurred when creating a calendar event with an assigned collaborator.
*   **Fix 3:** Added another `ALTER TABLE` command to `server/index.js` to automatically add the `colaborador_id` column to the `calendarios` table on server startup.
*   **Update 4:** After fixing the database issues, a new error `PayloadTooLargeError` appeared when trying to upload a file to a calendar event. This was corrected by increasing the request size limit in `body-parser`.
*   **Update 5:** The file upload still failed with a `SyntaxError: ... is not valid JSON`. This was caused by a conflict between the `body-parser` middleware (for JSON) and the `multer` middleware (for files).
*   **Fix 4:** Replaced the global `body-parser` middleware with a conditional one in `server/index.js`. The new middleware inspects the request's `Content-Type` and only applies the JSON parser if appropriate, preventing it from interfering with file uploads.
*   **Update 6:** Implemented role-based UI and logic for the Calendar Management page.
    *   **Frontend (`public/js/calendarios.js`, `public/pages/calendarios.html`):
        *   Added an "Observaciones" field to the event form.
        *   The UI now adapts based on the user's role.
        *   "Colaborador / Empleado" users now have a simplified view. They can only see their assigned tasks and can only update the status, add observations, and upload files. The form for creating new events is hidden for them.
        *   "Administrador General" and "Supervisor de Producci贸n" users retain full control.
    *   **Backend (`server/index.js`):
        *   Added `observaciones` (TEXT) and `fecha_completado` (DATETIME) columns to the `calendarios` table.
        *   The `PUT /calendarios/:id` endpoint now has role-based logic:
            *   It allows collaborators to update only the `estado` and `observaciones` fields.
            *   When a collaborator marks a task as "Completado", the `fecha_completado` is automatically set to the current timestamp.
            *   Admins and supervisors can update all event fields.
        *   The `POST /calendarios` endpoint was updated to include the new `observaciones` field.
*   **Update 7:** Enhanced calendar event display for "Administrador General" and "Supervisor de Producci贸n" roles.
    *   **Frontend (`public/pages/calendarios.html`):
        *   Added a new table header `<th>Adjunto</th>` to the `tabla-eventos` to display attached media.
    *   **Frontend (`public/js/calendarios.js`):
        *   Modified the `renderizarTabla` function to include a column for attached media, displaying a link to `evento.media_url` if it exists.
        *   Removed the `btn-ver-media` button as the media is now directly linked in the table.
*   **Fix 5:** Corrected the `GET /calendarios` endpoint in `server/index.js` to properly retrieve the `fecha_creacion` column from the database, resolving the issue where it was appearing blank in the frontend.
*   **Fix 6:** Modified the `GET /calendarios` endpoint in `server/index.js` to include the `media_url` by joining with the `calendario_media` table, ensuring attached files are displayed and downloadable in the frontend.
*   **Update 8:** Implemented fixes for media handling in calendar events.
    *   **Backend (`server/index.js`):
        *   Modified the `POST /calendarios/:id/media` endpoint to enforce a maximum of 3 images per calendar task. If the limit is exceeded, a 400 error is returned.
        *   Adjusted the `filePath` returned in the `POST /calendarios/:id/media` response to use `path.basename(file.path)` for a cleaner filename.
        *   Modified the `GET /calendarios` endpoint to return all associated media URLs as a JSON array (`media_urls`) instead of a single `media_url`.
        *   Corrected the path replacement logic in the `GET /calendarios` endpoint's SQL query to properly handle Windows path separators (e.g., `server\\uploads\\`) for improved cross-platform compatibility.
    *   **Frontend (`public/js/calendarios.js`):
        *   Modified the `renderizarTabla` function to correctly display multiple media attachments from the `media_urls` array. It now iterates through the array and displays image thumbnails for image files or a generic "Ver Adjunto" link for other file types.
        *   Updated the `btnSubirMedia` event listener to call `renderizarTabla()` after a successful media upload, ensuring the UI reflects the new attachments immediately.
*   **Update 9:** Resolved critical bugs preventing calendar events from being created and displayed.
    *   **Problem:** Users were unable to create new calendar events, and fetching existing events resulted in a `500 Internal Server Error`. Additionally, users with the "Colaborador" role encountered a `403 Forbidden` error.
    *   **Fix 7 (Backend):** Corrected the `POST /calendarios` endpoint in `server/index.js`, which was failing to include the mandatory `fecha` field in the `INSERT` statement.
    *   **Fix 8 (Backend):** Replaced the `JSON_ARRAYAGG` function with `GROUP_CONCAT` in the `GET /calendarios` endpoint to ensure compatibility with older MySQL versions. Also corrected the `GROUP BY` clause to comply with the `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` SQL mode, resolving the `500` error.
    *   **Fix 9 (Frontend):** Updated the `renderizarTabla` function in `public/js/calendarios.js` to parse the comma-separated string of media URLs returned by the updated backend.
    *   **Fix 10 (Frontend):** Modified the `init` function in `public/js/calendarios.js` to only load the list of collaborators for admin and supervisor roles, fixing the `403` error for collaborators.
    *   **Code Quality:** The `CREATE TABLE calendarios` statement was updated to include the `fecha_creacion` column by default, making the database schema more robust.
*   **Next Step:** Continue with general testing of the calendar and role-based permissions.
